	Warning:
	You may not need all the functions in this library. If speed
	is _extremely_ important, you may want to consider deleting
	functions you do not plan on using. Normally you should not
	have to worry about the size of the library.

	This code may be used freely.
	You may modify this code as you see fit, however, this header, and the header
	for the functions must remain intact.
