Example of use:

	holidays = arrayNew(1);
	holidays[1] = "YYYY-12-25"; // Dec 25 all years (Remember for your testing: this is a Sat in 2010 and Sun in 2011)
	holidays[2] = "YYYY-1-1";   // Jan 1 all years (is a Sat in 2011, Sun in 2012)
	holidays[3] = "2010-4-2";  // April 2, 2010 (Good friday) 

	date1 = CreateDateTime(2008,10,15,13,00,00);
	date2 = CreateDateTime(2011,2,1,6,00,00);
	
	days = countArbitraryDaysExcluding(date1,date2,"1,7",false,true,holidays); 
	
	writeOutput(", days=" & days);
	
Note:
includeStartDate - defaults to false so that if the startdate and enddate are the same the result will be 0, not 1

ignoreTimes - CF date functions treat a day as 24 hours and this can cause unexpected results in your date calulations.
eg the difference between today at 11pm and tomorrow at 6am is zero for dateDiff(). 
But for this UDF we would generally expect 1 day's difference. Therefore, optionally, ignore the times (defults to true).
